## Iâ€™m currently working on ... ðŸ”­
I'm currently working on a Smart Desk Project (https://github.com/Pseudonymous-gdy/Smart-Desk-in-HKUST-GZ-).
This is a project aimed at creating a desk that can alter shapes depending on the objects put on the desk.

## Iâ€™m currently learning ... ðŸŒ±
As an incoming sophomore, I'm currently delving into machine learning theorems, with available work and notes updated.
Also, I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning, and currently designing algorithms on bandit problems. Other related tasks are also preferred.

## I'm looking to collaborate on ... ðŸ‘¯
- Tasks on real world scenarios (preferred if related to AI skills)
- Mathematical study group on Probability, Real Analysis, etc.
- One who could offer a better photo for my profile (my current one is originated from Evan Chen [About Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/)).
