## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Pseudonymous-gdy/Pseudonymous-gdy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I'm a freshman from HKUST(GZ), and a beginner to Github! You may reach me through my student email if necessary:
dguo294@connect.hkust-gz.edu.cn

## Iâ€™m currently working on ... ðŸ”­
> [!tips]
> I'm currently working on a project trying to elaborate a model combining Mixture of Experts with Bayesian Learning. This project would last for about 3 months, with me as the only human author (of course I seek help from GenAI tools).

## Iâ€™m currently learning ... ðŸŒ±
> [!tips]
> As a sophomore, I'm currently delving into machine learning theorems and deep learning, with available work and notes updated.
Also, I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning, and currently designing algorithms on bandit problems. Other related tasks are also preferred.

## I'm looking to collaborate on ... ðŸ‘¯
- Tasks on real world scenarios (preferred if related to AI skills)
- Mathematical study group on Probability, Real Analysis, etc.
- Anything interested in working with the current project. (However, please notice that this project is currently for course requirements, and collaborations would not be available till December.)
- One who could offer a better photo for my profile (my current one is originated from Evan Chen [About Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc/)).
